# Density-Estimation-and-Classification-on-MNIST-Dataset
A subset of MNIST dataset containing handwritten digits of 7 and 8 is given. The aim of the
project is to train two different image classifiers to classify these two digits. Naive Bayes
Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier are used in this scenario. Both of them are trained
with two features. The features that are extracted from both the images are assumed to be
independent. The features used are:
* Mean value of all the pixel values in the image
* Standard deviation of all the pixel values in the image
